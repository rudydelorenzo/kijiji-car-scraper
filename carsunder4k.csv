The first 100,000km if it’s life was mainly highway as it was a fleet vehicle being used up north. I’ve put 20,000km on it over the last year, along the way I have made many repairs to it including: - Wiper motor - Battery - Rad Flush - Blower motor - Replace both rear wheel cylinders - Entirely new rear brake set up (drum brakes entirely replaced) - Parking brake cable was replaced - New tires (20,000km logged) - Transmission was rebuilt before I purchased it, unfortunately I don’t have the receipt for that. The only cons are that it needs a new windshield, it has the mid 90’s GM paint defect, and there is some slight rust on the rocker panels and rear bumper.

I have done work on the car to make it run nice and to be a reliable vehicle for someone looking.

Pros CV axle was just replaced, the driver side was done in January. Ignition wires, spark plugs and the valve cover gaskets were changed as well as the spark plug gaskets It runs and drives perfectly fine.

Changed the PCV Valve as well (The car will be washed and cleaned exterior and interior) It will also come with a full tank because f**k people that don't sell you a car without a full tank. The Bad Windshield washer pump and line need to be replaced (If you brought the parts I would happily install.) The paint was not done professionally not chipping but it is layered and not the best looking. Someone attempted to steal it so the driver's side lock is damaged (ALL ignition parts are 100% untouched. Just have to unlock passenger door then the driver.) Weak battery it will start all the time but you can hear the power going only needed one boost in the winter should be good enough to last the summer. The tires will have to be changed for winter (Hub cap warehouse quoted me $180 for four used tires and install.) Price is Firm.

No oil leaks whatsoever and doesnt even have a check engine light on! Engine was rebuilt and the 200,000 km mark and do have the paperwork to prove it.

Front brakes were done a little over a year ago. Cost me about $800 in parts alone. Oil changes done regularly, of course. This car is great and needs nothing. The clutch is in great shape too.

This truck has a lot of work done but needs a couple critical things which are reflected in the price. The good: -7700 series heavy half ton. Has the heavier axles, hubs, 4R100 transmission and lower 3.73 gears. Great for pulling or rolling big tires as you can see. -Long arm 6” lift -18” Rockstar II rims -New front end parts: upper and lower ball joints and new wheel bearings -brakes are good - aftermarket headlights/taillights -XLT package with captains chairs/center console -light bar -protective coating on rocker panels and in box -fender flares - Engine replaces by previous owner. I bought it in August last year. The new engine had about 112’000 on it then. It’s around 125’000 now. Starts and runs great. All done at Ford, I don’t have the original receipts from him but I’ve had no issues. -Touchscreen nav/stereo The not so good: -Needs a transmission. It will drive home but there’s not a lot of life left. A used 4R100 transmission will run you about 500-700 plus oil and you can put it in over an afternoon with the right tools. I don’t have the place or time to do it. - the tires aren’t great. Because of the front end issue they wore, everything is straightened out now but it does need tires.

1994,Used,GMC,C/K 3500,N/A,Pickup Truck,N/A,0,368000,N/A,N/A,4000,false,None,"Time for me to sell "The Green Bastard". I really don't need a truck this big as a daily driver. It has 369xxx on the odometer. HOWEVER: the motor is from a 95 truck that had 169xxx on it. The trans, transfer case, front diff, and rear diff internals are from a 97 truck with 178xxx on it. All installed 2 months ago. The trans likely has much fewer km on it as it has a build sticker from NAPC on it. So you know it's built tough. Everything works 100% as it should. The 6.5 turbo diesel motor has an upgraded GM8 turbo on it. Last summer new injectors, a newer injection pump, a new starter and new batteries were put in. I also installed the H.O. water pump, bigger rad, and 9 blade fan. I have now collected the double thermostat crossover and hose. I also have the belt needed to get rid of the vacuum pump and some odds and ends to make a turbo master. Brand new PMD installed last weekend. Exhaust has been cut and exits infront of the rear tires. I have an aftermarket down pipe to get rid of the golf ball pipe. Sounds great and you can hear the whistle really well. The injection pump has not been timed since installed. My local dealership doesnt have the scan tool anymore. But it does still run great and seems to pull fine. Has started ever morning this year. Not easily mind you, but it does. Inside it's full load for the year. The previous owner removed a pillar pod so theres holes in there. I mounted a triple guage unit under the dash with a boost guage. I planned on installing trans temp and egt but never got to it. I put in a DVD player though it doesnt sit quite right. A/C doesn't work currently (accumulator nit hooked up) nor does the cruise (I'm told it's the multifunction switch). Also needs a windshield. I also installed a glowplug bypass so you can warm them up longer to start easier. The steady bearing, tie rods, and ball joints were all replaced this past fall. I have not gotten it aligned. It will need tires. Worn and weather cracked. But I'm driving 84 km a day on them. Has a bent wheel in the back so there is a slight vibration. It's a little rough around the edges so it's not going to win any beauty pageants. I do have a drivers dually tub and fender. I have a grille. Theres a rear bumper in better shape. And a few more odds and ends I've squirreled away. If your still with me here, I'm looking to get $4000 o.b.o. Make an offer. Need gone. But I'm not giving it away either. I'm not looking to trade and I wont reply to low balls. Thanks for looking.",https://www.kijiji.ca/v-cars-trucks/edmonton/1994-1-ton-dually/1430842022

Has the trans so you can put what ever you want into it. Selling my Pajero project. Bought it from previous owner with a broken 6G74 as it dropped a valve and grenaded the engine when he was driving it. I always wanted to put a 1u into something and this was perfect. But it has been a few years and my focus has changed so I am selling it now. Interior is disassembled due to the wiring harness for the 1uzfe needing to be added in, but both are currently untouched. All interior is in the back seat ready to go back in. The rear cover was remade by the previous owner as the old canvas just fell apart. Had a plan to build a carbon fiber hard top but again, just have no desire to finish it. The paint just needs a polish, there is a small chip in the windshield on the drivers side but no cracks. Everything else is in good condition. No rust and it needs a cleaning but it is a very nice example. No diesel drama as well. The 4x4 system uses an air locker for the front irs and a straight axle for the rear. The story with the decals on the hood is interesting as it was an ex rally support car for "Team Dr. J-top" that was in Australia for a minute before being brought back to Japan and auctioned when the previous owner picked it up. Afaik there are a hand full of the J-Top version of the Pajero in North America, so this is a unique car to say the least. It also stands at 6'6" tall. So it isnt tiny to say the least.

The car is the touring trim level (top of line for the year), and the model year is 2005. The only reason I'm selling it is because I just purchased an Acura MDX. Mechanically, the car is perfect and runs without any issues whatsoever. It had the alternator and battery replaced in the winter, and an oil change done about 250 kilometres ago. The timing belt was replaced around 110,000km. The body also has no rust, which is rare for the year. The car is good to go, and needs no mechanical work done to it, as well all of the recalls are up to date. To say this car is reliable is an understatement. The car is loaded with both factory and after market features. Included is; power windows and sunroof, heated mirrors, cruise control, CD player, AC, tinted windows ($250), remote car starter ($400), and many more features. Mechanically speaking, the car needs nothing, however cosmetically there is minor damage to the bumper as shown in the third and fourth picture. The damage is hardly noticeable and makes no difference in the performance of the car. There is also a missing fog light on the driver side which is a very inexpensive fix. The car comes on winter tires with lots of tread left on them, and I will include the original alloy rims with limited tread on them. Please text me at 780-231-3021 for more information. I am located on the west end. No lowballs, dealers or shipping scams.

I was advised to replace two sensors since they are known to be problematic. I have not had time to take it in, and hardly use the car since I gained a work vehicle. The steering alignment will have to be done as it has produced wear on the tires. From what the repair report read when I bought it, the car was damaged shortly after new and required frame straightening but was cleared after repair. The transmission shifts roughly at times(I believe this is due to the speed sensor not knowing the speed of the car. The chances are that a test drive would not even show this. The paint was peeling and required some work to recoat the clearcoat. Not perfect, but it looks good. The pictures are recent. The inside needs a little cleaning. It has 7 seats too. Comes with another set of tires with nice rims. Winters are on now. There is a crack in the windshield on the passenger's side that does run the height of the glass. Having said all that, I think it is a good car, and worth all of my lowest price of $1900.00. Please respect my time and do not ask for a lower price. I can make it available to see or test drive weekday Mon - Thursday evenings.

This could be a great car but it just needs a little TLC. Also the key i have for the car was broken, which i did a quick braze repair on. The key still works and starts the car. I would have purchased a new key but the dealership required insurance which i do not currently have on the car. Im open to reasonable offers. Call or text 780 994 0836.

She runs great, shifts great, and is generally clean and tight. If you’ve never driven one of these cars: they are surprisingly light on their feet and they’re pretty good on gas for a full sized car. They have a 200 amp alternator, heavy duty suspension, heavy duty brakes, heavy duty coolers, dual exhaust, extra wide tires, the list goes on... This one comes with 5 matching summer tires and 5 matching winter tires all mounted and balanced on heavy duty steel wheels. The summers are Goodyear RS-A (cop spec) with about 6000km on them, and the winters are Bridgestone Blizzacks with about 3000km on them. I’ve also replaced the stereo deck with one that has Bluetooth connectivity for music streaming and hands free calling. The bad: the a/c doesn’t work, it never has for me. To be honest I’ve never properly diagnosed it and it could be really easy to fix. The rear defroster doesn’t work; I HAVE tried to diagnose this and I thought I had it fixed a couple times but it’s back to not working. The mirror defrosters DO work. Her paint isn’t perfect; I wouldn’t even call it good, but in ghost car grey I still think she looks cool. One of the rear rotors is warped from when one of the calliper slides rusted up. I replaced the slides but the warped rotor creates a pulsing in the brake pedal that is just enough to be annoying. If I was going to keep her I’d probably replace that. The asking price is $3900.

Truck is Loyal and starts in -30c every time. 4x4 Works great. Has an almost mint interior with just a little tear in the driver seat, other than that the rest is almost perfect. Has the front bucket seats with the middle seat and three seats in the back. Truck has had over $2,000 worth of work done in the last year alone. Brand new Tires and brakes, less than 100Km on them. Brand new Alternator, Transfer Case Control Module, Radiator and Condenser. With paperwork. The $9,000 custom stereo starts with MB Quart tweeters in the door, with 2 crossover units under the front seats and 4 MB Quart 6.75 Mids in the front and rear doors, in the back sub enclosure is 2 Boston GT24 1500W amps with 2 Boston G3 12" Subs in the enclosure, The enclosure is in the box of the truck with a passthrough to the rear seats, all sealed up nice and neatly with armor guard and a rubber gasket between the box and the cab, this thing hits hard and sounds great. Has had oil changed every 5k since I owned it and has never been smoked in while I owned it. Has had a muffler delete and isnt too loud but has a nice throaty roar on acceleration. The 4.7L Magnum V8 under the hood has some nice power. The body is in great shape except it has some rust on the passenger fender. No dents or scratches on it. The bad: Blue bumper - Was in a minor accident and had to put it on, Wouldnt be hard to find a red one or paint the existing one, I just didnt have the time to find a red one. Engine has a knock - Will need to be rebuilt or replaced, A 4.7 can be had for around $500. It still runs but knocks. This would be a perfect first car or project truck for a teenager, as the stereo is great and it doesnt need alot of work other than the engine work. Or great for someone who wants a great competition stereo without paying the price for it. Give me a text at 587-277-1650 if you want to come look at it or hear the stereo. Or if you want more pictures Looking to get $3,500 (Negotiable) because of the engine work it requires, this is a nice truck.",https://www.kijiji.ca/v-cars-trucks/edmonton/2001-dodge-dakota-slt-custom-subs/1427165106
