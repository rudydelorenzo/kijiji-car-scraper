I was advised to replace two sensors since they are known to be problematic. I have not had time to take it in, and hardly use the car since I gained a work vehicle. The steering alignment will have to be done as it has produced wear on the tires. From what the repair report read when I bought it, the car was damaged shortly after new and required frame straightening but was cleared after repair. The transmission shifts roughly at times(I believe this is due to the speed sensor not knowing the speed of the car. The chances are that a test drive would not even show this. The paint was peeling and required some work to recoat the clearcoat. Not perfect, but it looks good. The pictures are recent. The inside needs a little cleaning. It has 7 seats too. Comes with another set of tires with nice rims. Winters are on now. There is a crack in the windshield on the passenger's side that does run the height of the glass. Having said all that, I think it is a good car, and worth all of my lowest price of $1900.00. Please respect my time and do not ask for a lower price.
